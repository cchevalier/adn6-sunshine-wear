by CChevalier, Feb. 2016

## Introduction

- Original code for the Sunshine app taken from [branch 7.05](https://github.com/udacity/Advanced_Android_Development/tree/7.05_Pretty_Wallpaper_Time) of the Udacity [repository](https://github.com/udacity/Advanced_Android_Development)

## Notes
- [Set up an Android Wear Emulator] (https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/creating.html#SetupEmulator)

    Forward the AVD's communication port to the connected handheld device (you must do this every time the handheld is connected):  

    ``` C:\Users\cch\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platform-tools\adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601 ```
